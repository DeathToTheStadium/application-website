# Database Security Measures 

__My personal philosophy__


## Database Security 1

there are three things that need to be kept in mind when handling data and security 

the CRUDs ACROYNYM, SANITIZE LOGIC , & NEVER TRUST USERS BUT VERIFY
having these three things in mind when developing security will prevent any one person 
from being able to damage a system control , destroy a system

* CRUDS 
    * Why is CRUDS important for the most effective security ?
    * how to handle Creating  data 
    * how to handle Reading   data 
    * how to handle Updating  data 
    * how to handle Deleting  data 
    * how to handle Searching data 
    * Writing classes to handle queries and hiding data in the backend 
* Sanitization logic
    * retrieve keys from unknown gates
    * handling personal data types 
    * Redirects and preventing indexing
    * encryption and hashing 
    * Separation of logic from userintface  MVC
* DISTRUST YOURSELF AND ANYONE WITH DATA
    * The need to know basis
    * Authorizations and verification
    * Why No One Should have all the power to CRUDS

# CRUDS 

when working with data there are only a few things that are posible in every concievable way to handle 
data and because of this controlling how ,why ,when ,& what is the best way to handle making queries to a database this is where different methods come in to make security possible when you are trying to prevent loss of data, damage to data, or the loss of control over data so in short this is my best 
whack at security when it comes to building any systems
