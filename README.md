# Welcome to our website documentation 
I built this website as a way for me to learn and grow my it skills and 
currently this is my third time trying to build a website that i can be proud of 
so im going to be taking the time to build everything step by step 
so ill be listing off everything i made in order so i can have a graphical tree and some commentary for myself so when i build the next website it doesnt end in solid failure like this one has 

__so lets get started__

## key notes:

* Getting Started
    * Setting up a repository 
    * Writing my mark down page 
    * Building my Folder structure
    * Setting up all of my apis 
    * Begin the project
* Building the project and growing
    * Building My First MVC Framework 





# Getting started 
__So when i began,__ i had to go to github.com and create a new repository from scratch and relearn how git hub works 
so i can start building my repository [APPLICATION-WEBSITE](https://github.com/goldenexecutive/application-website) 

after i did this i had to watch a tutorial about the differences between git and github 
a subtle but very annoying difference and i ended up learning the basics because ussually 
when i tried to use the command line i would use ...

```c#
git clone // my github repo

//after that i had to make sure everything that wrote was added to stages

git add --all 

// then check the status of git so i can make sure what i want to commit is committed correctly

git status

// after i did that i had to commit everything to stages

git commit -m " then my personal message "

# and finnally 

git push 
```

__so this experience has helped me gain more confidence which is why,__
im just now starting to work buolding application correctly now and acctually taking the time
to build up this documentation so yeh thats where i am now 

## Writing my __Mark Down__ page 
so cant say much about this till after im done writing my folder structure so i can continue 
this documentation im working on
